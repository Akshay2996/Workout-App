# Workout App

🏋️‍♀️ A MERN stack workout application that uses JWT authentication and lets you create workouts and shows workout for specific user.

## Backend

Run the terminal

- Go to `cd backend` folder
- Run the command `npm run dev` to run the backend server

**Note:** Before running the command, Connect **`mongoDb Atlas`** to the server and give the necessary network access to link to the database.
Also create the `.env` file in backend folder with the help of `.env-example` that takes your secret key needed to run the backend server.

**Do not upload `.env` file to github or any cloud service for security purpose**

## Frontend

Run another terminal

- Go to `cd frontennd` folder
- Run the command `npm start` to run the frontend server
